# Redmine ponderation plugin

Redmine plugin to calculate the ponderation of a ticket.

## Installation

This plugin requieres the qualification plugin by default, but you can use the vanilla branch if you dont wish to use it.

- Clone or download this repository into your redmine's plugins folder
- restart the redmine server
- configure the plugin in the admin pannel

## Endpoints requierement

The plugin currently supports GET HTTP request only. The plugin appends to the endpoint the user query which corresponds to issue_description (or if "Prepend the title" is check: issue_title + " " + issue_description).

The endpoint must return a JSON response.

## Usage with LUIS

The plugin configuration is flexible enough to be used with many existing services. Here is a quick walk-through to set up a binding with LUIS.

In this example, we will rewrite the subject to either "new functionalities", "security issue", "graphical glitch" or "logic problem" based on the ticket's description.

1. First you should create or login into a [luis account](https://www.luis.ai/home)
2. Create a new app on [your dashboard](https://www.luis.ai/applications)
3. Create 4 intents named "new functionalities", "security issue", "graphical glitch" and "logic problem"
4. Train your model by giving it examples of ticket description for each intent
5. When your model is getting accurate click on the publish tab
6. Copy your luis endpoint at the bottom of the page
7. Now heads to your Redmine server on the qualification configuration page (/settings/plugin/qualification)
8. Set "Limit the query length" to 499 to respect LUIS restrictions, set "Response path" to "topScoringIntent.intent" and paste the endpoint in the text box for "subject"
9. Now, when someone creates a ticket LUIS determine the best matching title and the plugin set it automatically!
